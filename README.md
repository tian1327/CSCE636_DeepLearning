# CSCE636_DeepLearning
Homework and projects for deep learning course.

* HW1: play with `MNIST` classification task by changing the layers and neurons, report the accuracy
* HW2: `GradientTape` API and hyperparameter tuning for `IMDB` dataset
* HW3: mix `MNIST` dataset, explore regularization with dropout, L1, L2 
* HW4: build `one-input-multiple-output` model for `MNIST` dataset with 10 binary classifiers, use `Functional API`, `Subclassing`, `Customized Callback`
* HW5: transfer learning with `ResNet50` pretrained model, explored two implementations w/ or w/o data augmentation. Fine tuning by unfreezing last few layers
* HW6: `Image Segmentation` model, intrepret DL by visualizing `intermediate activations`, `convnet filters`, `heatmap of class activation` using `Grad-CAM` 

* Project 1: fitting `Noisy MNIST` data, tried with `AutoEncoder` for denoising, `CNN` with `regularization/dropout` to avoid overfitting, `data augmentation` by mixing with original clean MNIST
* Project 2: `Machine Translation` using `Transformer Architecture`, `Transformer Encoder & Decoder`, `Positional Embedding`, `Text Vectorization`
* Project 3: `Language Modeling` for `next-word predication`. Explored `Transformer Decoder`, `Transformer Encoder for multi-class classification`
